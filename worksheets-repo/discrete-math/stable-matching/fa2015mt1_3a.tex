\begin{question}
For $n=2$ or any 2 man, 2 woman stable marriage instance, man $A$ has the same optimal and pessimal woman. (T/F)
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
\hint{Try to draw out some examples - what happens when you reverse man $A$'s preference list?}
\step{If man $A$ always has the same optimal and pessimal woman, this means that there is only one stable pairing across all instances, which is false.}
\end{solution}

\begin{question}
In any stable marriage instance, in the pairing in TMA, there is some man who gets his favorite woman. (T/F)
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
\hint{Again, try to draw out some examples (in particular, try $n\ge 3$)}
\step{Consider the stable marriage instance below:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc|cc}
M & & W & \hline
A & (2,3,1) & 1 & (A,B,C) \\
B & (1,2,3) & 2 & (B,C,A) \\
C & (2,1,3) & 3 & (C,A,B)
\end{tabular}
Then the stable pairing is $(A, 3), (B, 2), (C,1),$ which is suboptimal for every person.
\end{center}}
\end{solution}
